# Reverse Coding 2k26

A website/platform for hosting the OG - **CCxEnigma: TESSERACT** event — a unique programming challenge where participants reverse engineer the logic from input-output patterns.

You can use this platform for hosting your reverse coding event too.

## About the Event

In Reverse Coding, participants are presented with a **black box interface**:

- They provide **inputs** to the system and observe the corresponding **outputs**
- The actual problem statement is **not given** — participants must deduce the underlying logic
- Based on the patterns they discover, participants **submit code** that implements the reverse-engineered logic

This challenges participants to think critically, recognize patterns, and demonstrate their problem-solving skills without explicit instructions.


## Somethings about the platform:

- The platform capable of full **Registration**, display **Leaderboard**, and most important thing -> Running the **Black Box**.

- The main thing is that participant should not get the **code** behind the black box in any case. So I used this architecture:

- The live leaderboard architecture:
   -  "Whole Function" Memoization: Utilizes Next.js 15's `use cache` to memoize the entire aggregation pipeline (Codeforces API + Supabase DB + Merge Logic), reducing database load to zero during high-traffic refreshes.

   - Serverless-Safe Rate Limiting: Implements a custom 10s cacheLife profile to act as a statistical buffer against Vercel's concurrent instance scaling, ensuring zero risk of hitting Codeforces' strict API limits.
