# Reverse Coding 2k26

A website for hosting the **CCxEnigma: TESSERACT** event — a unique programming challenge where participants reverse engineer the logic from input-output patterns.

## About the Event

In Reverse Coding, participants are presented with a **black box interface**:

- They provide **inputs** to the system and observe the corresponding **outputs**
- The actual problem statement is **not given** — participants must deduce the underlying logic
- Based on the patterns they discover, participants **submit code** that implements the reverse-engineered logic

This challenges participants to think critically, recognize patterns, and demonstrate their problem-solving skills without explicit instructions.
